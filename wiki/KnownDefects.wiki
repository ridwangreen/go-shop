*Colors in add category*: High
  * The spinner drop-down list in the Add Category screen currently displays the hex code for the color.
  * Change the getView method so that it sets the background color of each dropdown item to the hex code, and display no text

*Add Item toast*: Low
  * The main screen displays a toast saying an item is added whenever the "ADD" button is pressed, even if the item isn't actually added
  * Use the boolean returns to check if the add item behavior worked before displaying the toast
