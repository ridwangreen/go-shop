This page will discuss the differences in the ItemManager and the controller

= Introduction =

The Controller and ItemManager classes look very similar, however they both will fill a separate role which may be apparent once development continues.


= Details =


The *ItemManager* is used to modify the data of the application as well as save and load the data when it needs to be.

The *Controller* is responsible for communicating the data from the back end of the application to the UI.
