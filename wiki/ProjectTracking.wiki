#High-level division of labor

= Introduction =

This page should list things we need to do


= Details =

Current subdivisions of labor:
  * Create an XSD for category persistence, and a reader/writer. Configure a content resolver to manage that information
   * *DIFFICULTY*: Medium

  * Create an activity for each screen of the gui: Main, Category Manager, Add Category, Edit Category, Settings, and the menu screen. This includes making the GUI color-friendly and accessible
   * *DIFFICULTY*: Hard (Further subdivision might be needed)

  * Create back-end to manage the activity life-cycles and general execution of the program
   * *DIFFICULTY*: Easy
